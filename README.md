## Hey there! 👋

I'm a data-driven problem-solver working at the intersection of **energy, analytics and emerging tech**.  
Currently experimenting with:

- Python · SQL · Power BI  
- AI/ML prototypes (LLMs, vector DBs)  
- Smart-contract sandboxes & DeFi dashboards  
- CI/CD on GitHub Actions + Docker  

### What to expect here
Repo notes, quick-and-dirty proofs of concept, and the occasional long-form write-up when something clicks.

Always happy to discuss ideas—feel free to open an issue or start a discussion!
